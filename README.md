# Boat-Obstacle-Avoidance

- **main**: Used for visualization like what CamDemo(WithDepth) does.
- Configurations:
    - pipeline.py: **model path** and **IspScale**, the same as CamDemo(WithDepth).
    - main.py: **GRID_NUM_H**, **GRID_NUM_W** is the same as CamDemo(WithDepth). However, the model's **INPUT_SHAPE** needs to be specified manually. You can ignore these settings if you don't want to visualize.
